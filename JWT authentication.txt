Authentication is required to access this resource. Please provide a valid authentication token in the `Authorization` header.

token-->  random - hexa decimal(0-9 a-f A-F)

simple stry:

a person with token in approved to access the api 
a person without token is not approved to access the api

How do we decide to give the token?

we provide token to everyone who provides the username and password!


when we have the username and passs we generate the token

we get the token only when we log in not when we sign up

even after we login he cannot acces withhout permission.

username/pass----->login-----> token

token--------> username

there is a lab
total of 1000 students
only 50 has enrolled for the lab
the teacher is assigned for the lab
the one with the token is allowed by the teacher but the teacher will see if he has enrolled.
if he has enrolled he will be allowed to enter the lab
else he will be redirected to another teacher where he can enroll to the lab or course
then once he is enrolled 
he again tries to enter the lab
the teacher again checks if he has enrolled
as he is enrolled he is allowed


the encoded data changes according to the payload data!

there is some libraries in node which is used to generate the encoded data which is used in the enterprises


the token has expiry



JWT security Config

- his doc assumes that u have creted fw apis and that your application works without any errors at this point

Steps for security Config

Step1: Install libraries

-bcrypt.js: generates hashcode of passwords.We do not save password in DB in plain text.we encrypt it as save encrypttext(cipher text)

- jsonwebtoken:- JWT this helps us to create a hexa decimal token for api call

- express-validator:- 

to install :
npm i bcryptjs jsonwebtoken express-validator
