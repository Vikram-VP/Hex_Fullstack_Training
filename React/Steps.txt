1. create an app using following utilites
    a. create-react-app
    b.vite ***

now we are using vite :
npm create vite@latest name

the react folder and files would have been created 
check out the package.json 

some dependencies would have been shown but we have to install them so 

use 

npm install

index.html

<div id="root"></div>  <-- index tell react, pls load the root component

the control from here goes to src/main.jsx

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>,
) 

this is telling react, please load the <App/> component in place of <div id='root'> </div>
